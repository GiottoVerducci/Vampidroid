## Vampidroid

Vampidroid is a mobile management solution for your Vampire: The Eternal Struggle™ card game cards.

With it you will be able to search card text, manage your deck and many other things.


## How to compile

In order to compile Vampidroid, you will need to download: 

* ActionBarSherlock https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock 
and 
* ViewPagerIndicator https://github.com/JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator


Just open these projects in your Eclipse. To do that, just follow step 1 of the instructions in the 
ActionBarSherlock download page: http://actionbarsherlock.com/download.html.

After that, in the Vampidroid project, go to Project Properties -> Android and in the Library section, 
remove the current references which may be not working and add new ones pointing to the projects you just opened.

Please, let me know if you have any problems setting this up.
